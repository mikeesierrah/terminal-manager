Hereâ€™s the Markdown version of your README:


## Usage

### 1. Install the Manager
First, install the Terminal Manager using the installation script:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikeesierrah/terminal-manager/refs/heads/main/manager.sh)
```

### 2. Configure a Node
Next, set up a node using the Node Terminal script:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikeesierrah/terminal-manager/refs/heads/main/node.sh)
```

During setup, you will be prompted for:
- **Username & Password**: This is not your server's login credentials. Use a strong, random username and password.
- **IP Address**: Enter the IP of your main server. This is crucial, as it will restrict access from other IPs.
- **Port**: Specify a port for the node service to listen on. Make sure to note this down for later use.

### 3. Add the Node to the Manager
Once the node is set up, go to the Manager server and add the node using the following command:

```bash
terminal-manager add NODENAME NODE_IP LISTEN_PORT
```

Replace `NODE_IP` and `LISTEN_PORT` with the values you set earlier.

- `NODENAME` is optional, but each terminal must have a unique name.

Then, open your browser and navigate to:

```
https://your-domain.com/NODENAME/
```

You will be prompted for your terminal username and password. Enter the correct credentials to connect.

## Security Recommendations

### Disable SSH on Your Server
For added security, disable SSH access on your server. For Ubuntu 24.04, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now ssh
```

### Enhance Security with a CDN and CAPTCHA
To further protect access to your terminal, consider placing your domain behind a CDN and enabling CAPTCHA. This helps prevent bots or malicious actors from brute-forcing your credentials.
